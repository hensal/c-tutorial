This function takes two strings s1 and s2 as an argument and finds the first occurrence of the sub-string s2 in the string s1.
The process of matching does not include the terminating null-characters(‘\0’), but function stops there.
Syntax:
char *strstr (const char *s1, const char *s2);
Parameters:
s1: This is the main string to be examined.
s2: This is the sub-string to be searched in s1 string.
Return Value: This function returns a pointer points to the first character of the found s2 in s1 otherwise a null pointer if s2 is not present in s1. 
If s2 points to an empty string, s1 is returned.

Application : Replace a string with another
The strstr() function returns pointer to the first occurrence of the matched string in the given string.
It is used to return substring from first match till the last character.

#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
int main () {
   const char haystack[20] = "TutorialsPoint";
   const char needle[10] = "T";
   char *ret;
   ret = strstr(haystack, needle);
   printf("The substring is: %s\n", ret);   
   return(0);
}

OUTPUT:
       The substring is: TutorialsPoint
       
Program2:
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>  
int main()
{
    // Take any two strings
    char s1[] = "GeeksforGeeks";
    char s2[] = "for";
    char* p;  
    // Find first occurrence of s2 in s1
    p = strstr(s1, s2);  
    // Prints the result
    if (p) {
        printf("String found\n");
        printf("First occurrence of string '%s' in '%s' is '%s'", s2, s1, p);
    } else
        printf("String not found\n");  
    return 0;
}
Output:
String found
First occurrence of string 'for' in 'GeeksforGeeks' is 'forGeeks'

Application:Application : Replace a string with another
In this example with the help of strstr() function we first searches for the occurrence of STL sub-string in s1 and after that replaces that word with Strings.

// CPP program to illustrate strstr()
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>  
int main()
{
    // Take any two strings
    char s1[] = "Fun with STL";
    char s2[] = "STL";
    char* p;  
    // Find first occurrence of s2 in s1
    p = strstr(s1, s2);  
    // Prints the result
    if (p) {
        strcpy(p, "Strings");
        printf("%s", s1);
    } else
        printf("String not found\n");  
    return 0;
}
Output:
Fun with Strings
