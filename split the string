how to split a string into several tokens using strtok function. 
To split a string we need delimiters - delimiters are characters which will be used to split the string.

Suppose, we've the following string and we want to extract the individual words.

char str[] = "strtok needs to be called several times to split a string";
The words are separated by space. So space will be our delimiter.

char delim[] = " ";
strtok accepts two strings - the first one is the string to split, the second one is a string containing all delimiters. In this case there is only one delimiter. strtok returns a pointer to the character of next token. So the first time it is called, it will point to the first word.

char *ptr = strtok(str, delim);
strtok needs to be called several times to split a string
^
ptr points here
But there is another thing. strtok modifies the original string. It puts NULL characters ('\0') at the delimiter position after every call to strtok so that tokens can be tracked. strtok also internally remembers the next token's starting position. So after the first call to strtok, the str, ptr and next token position looks like as follows:

strtok\0needs to be called several times to split a string
^       ^
|       next token
|
ptr points here
In the next call to strtok, the first parameter needs to be NULL so that strtok starts splitting the string from the next token's starting position it remembers.

ptr = strtok(NULL, delim);
strtok returns NULL when there is no more tokens, i.e., the whole string is split. This can be utilized to know when to stop calling strtok.


#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
	char str[] = "strtok,needs,to,be,called,several,times,to,split,a,string";
	int init_size = strlen(str);
	char delim[] = ",";

	char *ptr = strtok(str, delim);

	while(ptr != NULL)
	{
		printf("'%s'\n", ptr);
		printf("%s\n", ptr);
		ptr = strtok(NULL, delim);
	}
	return 0;
}

OUTPUT1:        OUTPUT2:
'strtok'        strtok
'needs'         needs
'to'            to
'be'            be
'called'        called
'several'       several
'times'         times
and so on.        and so on.

Note:Delimiter can be any.
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
	char str[] = "strtok needs to be called several times to split a string";
	int init_size = strlen(str);
	char delim[] = "ai";
	
	char *ptr = strtok(str, delim);

	while (ptr != NULL)
	{
		printf("'%s'\n", ptr);
		ptr = strtok(NULL, delim);
	}
	return 0;
}
