Structure is a user defined data type. It is a collection of different types combined together to create a new type.

Let us declare a student structure containing three fields i.e. name, roll and marks.
struct student
{
    char  name[100];
    int   roll;
    float marks;
};

How to initialize a structure variable?
Initialize structure using dot operator:
In C, we initialize or access a structure variable either through dot . or arrow -> operator. This is the most easiest way to initialize or access a structure.
Example:

// Declare structure variable
struct student stu1;

// Initialize structure members
stu1.name  = "Pankaj";
stu1.roll  = 12;
stu1.marks = 79.5f;

[OR]
// Declare and initialize structure variable
struct student stu1 = { "Pankaj", 12, 79.5f };

Variant of value initialized structure variable:
Example:
// Declare and initialize structure variable
struct student stu1 = { 
    .roll  = 12,
    .name  = "Pankaj",
    .marks = 79.5f
};
Structure default initialization:
Default initialization of a variable considered as good programming practice.
Example:

// Define macro for default structure initialization
#define NEW_STUDENT { "", 0, 0.0f }
// Default initialization of structure variable
struct student stu1 = NEW_STUDENT;
