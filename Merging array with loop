PROGRAM :
question:without using any external functions the two arrays are getting automatically merged why?

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int A[] = {1,4,6,8};
    int B[] = {2,3,5,7};    
    printf("Before sorting : ");    
    for(int i = 0; i<8; i++) {
        printf("%d " , A[i]);
    }
OUTPUT :
Before sorting: 1 4 6 8 2 3 5 7

answer:It's called undefined behavior.You are accessing array A out of bounds so anything may happen.
